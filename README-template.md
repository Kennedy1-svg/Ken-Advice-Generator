## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Advice API
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Doing this project made me understand APIs and how to interact them using the Async and await method and Fetch. 

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(api);
  console.log(response.data)
}

proudOfThisFunc()
```

### Continued development

With my knowledge of APIs, I intend working more with them and the various HTTP methods that can be used to interact with the data they provide.
